You will be given 1-2 data processing questions during this portion. This will be a hands-on technical investigation of data problems. We are looking not only for coding skills, but also for the ability to design an operational approach to figure out a concrete answer to a specific question using data.

Sample Questions:

- Given timestamps of logins, figure out how many people on Facebook were active all seven days of a week on a mobile phone.
- How do you determine what product in Facebook was used most by the non-employee users for the last quarter? [Required parameters will be given]

While the actual data presented in the technical question will vary based on the question being asked, you can expect to see event-level data, dimension-level data, or both. This data set is designed forinterview purposes and is not representative of the large data sets we work with at FB.

Mock Data and Questions:

Here's a couple of examples that don't pertain specifically to Facebook but are representative of the kind of data and format with which you'll be presented:

Event-level data: an attendance log for every student in a school district

date | student_id | attendance

Dimension-level data: a summary table with demographics for each student in the district

student_id | school_id | grade_level | date_of_birth | hometown

Using this data, you could answer questions like the following:

- What was the overall attendance rate for the school district yesterday?
- Which grade level currently has the most students in this school district?
- Which school had the highest attendance rate? The lowest?

You will be expected to write code that would answer the data processing questions given based on a schema or set of schemas that will be provided to you. Whether you choose SQL, Python, or R, please follow standard coding style and best practices for easy readability.

If using SQL, you can expect to be assessed on some subset of the following:

- Write a query or set of queries to derive insights based on the given log(s) or schema(s)
- Work with aggregate functions
- Utilize different types of Joins (IE: Left, Inner, Outer, etc.)
- Utilize Union and Union All.
- Work with concepts including Distinct, Random Sampling, De-Duplication, Optimization.
- Apply the results of your analysis to make product decisions or suggestions.
